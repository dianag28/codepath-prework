          <h2>
            Welcome to the poppin' game from the 80s: Light and Sound. This game was designed to test your memory.
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>How to play:</strong> When you are ready to play, press Start.
            The game will then start by changing the appearance of the color blocks and you will hear a sound based
           on the secret pattern chosen by your computer. For the player, the object of the game is to repeat back 
            the pattern of the computer. The player has to repeat the previous pattern by memory. If you
            don't get it correct you will be brought back to the home screen, but you can always try again!
